# Equipment Overhauled v 0.3


Greetings, comrade!  Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition is a well thought out tabletop system that simplifies and streamlines gameplay and combat.  However, calculating how much weight a character is carrying is difficult to track, and characters being able to carry up to their carrying capacity with little to no downsides is a immersion breaking idea.  This ruleset can be added to the existing 5e system in order to make equipment more immersive and give players more interesting choices when deciding how to equip themselves for combat.

# Item Slots

Character inventory will now be managed using item slots instead of weight.  The slots an item occupies is an abstraction of its weight, size, and wieldyness. The storage capacity of bags, belts, sheathes, and your character's ability to carry that equipment are measured in slots.  The more item slots a character has avaliable, the more they can carry.  

## Carrying Capacity

Stronger characters are able to carry more without adverse effects while more hardy characters are able to better withstand being overloaded.  A character's base carrying capacity is a number of slots equal to their Strength ability score.  However, your character can choose to take on levels of encumbrance in order to increase their carrying capacity based on the table below.

**Carry Capacity.**  A character's carrying capacity is equal to their Strength score.

## Encumbrance

A player holding more items than their carrying capacity will take on levels of encumbrance.  The following table describes how many extra slots a character can carry and how many levels of encumbrance they will take on based on their CON modifier.

#### Extra Slots per Encumbrance Level

| CON modifier |1   |2   |3   |4   |5   |6   |7   |8   |9   |10  |
|:-------------|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|+5            |+5  |+10 |+15 |+20 |+25 |+30 |+35 |+40 |+45 |+50 |
|+4            |+4  |+8  |+12 |+16 |+20 |+24 |+28 |+32 |+36 |+40 |
|+3            |+3  |+6  |+9  |+12 |+15 |+18 |+21 |+24 |+27 |+30 |
|+2            |+2  |+4  |+6  |+8  |+10 |+12 |+14 |+16 |+18 |+20 |
|+1            |+1  |+2  |+3  |+4  |+5  |+6  |+7  |+8  |+9  |+10 |
|+0            |+1  |+2  |+2  |+3  |+3  |+4  |+4  |+5  |+5  |+6  |
|-1            |+1  |+1  |+2  |+2  |+3  |+3  |+4  |+4  |+5  |+5  |
|-2            |+0  |+1  |+1  |+1  |+2  |+2  |+2  |+3  |+3  |+3  |
|-3            |+0  |+0  |+0  |+0  |+1  |+1  |+1  |+1  |+1  |+2  |


Each encumbrance levels adds an additional negative effect during combat.  These effects stack until your character can no longer move.

#### Combat Encumbrance

|Encumbrance Levels|Adverse Effects|
|---|---|
|1| Reduce your Dodge by 2|
|2| Reduce your Dodge to 0|
|3| -5 speed|

|5| Disadvantage on DEX ability checks|
|6| -5 speed(-10 total)|
|7| Disadvantage on attack rolls|
|8| Disadvantage on all rolls|
|9+| -5 speed(stacks until speed is 0)|

|---|---|
|1-5| None|
|6-9| Traveling distance reduced by 5 miles|
|10-11| Traveling distance cut in half.  Take one level of exhaustion after 8 hours of traveling|
|12+| Cannot travel|


## Trinkets, Coins and Wallets

Rings, keys, candles and other small items are classified as trinkets.  **Trinkets** are items that are too small and light to take up an item slot.  A **wallet** is a 1 slot item that has 10 trinket-slots for trinkets.  Each mini-slot can hold 1 trinket or 20 coins.  Therefore each wallet can hold 200 coins or 10 trinkets, or some combination of the two.  Without a wallet, coins and trinkets may get lost during travel or combat.  Each player starts with a free wallet that holds their starting coins and trinkets.  A wallet can be kept on a belt or in a backpack.

Many gemstones are trinkets that are worth more than their weight in gold coins.  If a character doesn't have space to carry all of their gold, consider keeping gemstones of high values such as diamonds, which take up only on trinket slot, but are worth significantly more gold.

On the item table, trikets are denoted by having a size of T(meaning trinket)

\pagebreak

### Collective items
Some items, such as rations, ammuniton, or oil flasks can fit more than one into a single item slot.  For example, up to 5 cold rations or 20 arrows can fit in a single item slot.  While you can fit up to 5 rations in a single item slot, if you only have 1 ration, it still takes up an item slot, as does a single arrow.


## Containers
Carrying capacity tells how much a character can carry, but those items must be carried in containers.  Items can be carried in backpacks, belt pouches, sheathes, hands, etc.  Different containers offer different features for a character.

|Container|Size| Slots|
|---|---|---|
|Backpack|0|9 |
|Belt    |0|3 |
|Quiver  |0|1*|
|Sheath  |0|4 |
|Sack    |0|15|
|Chest   |3|25|
|Trunk   |6|35|
|Barrel  |9|45|

*Quiver can hold 1 slot of ammo and any sized ranged weapon


#### Backpack
The most popular container for essential items while traveling, the backpack can be carried on the back without any negative repercussions.  Grabbing an item out of the backpack takes 1 action.  The backpack can be shrugged off and dropped as a free action.

For flying characters, backpacks prevent flying

#### Belt
The belt is useful for carrying important items that must be accessed quickly.  Only items that are 1 slot or smaller can fit in the belt.  Items in/on the belt can be grabbed as a free action.

#### Quiver
Ammo can be grabbed from the quiver as part of the Attack action.  Pulling a ranged weapon off of a quiver costs a bonus action.

#### Sheath
Weapons can be stored in the quiver and drawn using a bonus action.  The term sheath can refer to an actual leather sheath or scabbard, or a belt loop or strap that can hold the weapon.

#### Sack
Sacks require one hand to hold. If a character is caught in combat while holding a sack, they may either drop the bag as a free action and risk damaging the items inside, or they may spend an action setting down the bag carefully.

#### Chest,Barrel,Trunk
Containers larger than a sack start begin to have weight themselves.  These containers' maximum slots include their own weight (so a chest can carry 22 slots, and will weigh 25 slots etc.).  These containers always require two hands to hold.  If two characters carry a large container jointly, both of them need two hands to hold the container.

#### Saddlebags
A variant bag that can only be carried by beasts of burden.  Saddlebags can carry up to 20 item slots.  Beasts of burden with a higher carrying capacity can only carry more by using a cart or wagon of some sort.

# Armor Changes
Armor is getting a big overhaul.  The biggest change to armor is the addition of the Dodge mechanic, which changes how DEX affects Armor Class.

## Armor Class
A character's armor class no longer depends on that character's DEX modifier.  Characters in light armor have lower AC than characters in heavy armor, which makes sense thematically and encourages the use of heavier armors.  Lightly armored characters are better at dodging a single attacker while heavily armored characters can better hold their own against many small attacks.

## Dodge
Dextrous characters who are not impeded by their armor are able to use their mobility to avoid attacks.  All characters have one dodge action that refreshes at the start of their turn.  Each chracter has a Dodge modifier equal to their DEX modifier, up to the limit of the armor they have equipped.  When a character is hit by an attack, they may use their dodge action to add their dodge modifier to their AC against the attack after the attack roll is made. 

AC and Dodge can be represented as follows:

```AC+Dodge```

For example, A character with Leather armor and a DEX modifier of +5 would denote their AC as `12+5`

## Damage Reduction
Some armors protect their wearer even when an attack hits.  When a characte with armor that provides damage reduction takes bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, reduce that damage by the amount of damage reduction(half-proficiency is rounded down)

## Armor Types

#### Light Armor
Light armor is designed to allow for mobility while providing a bit of protection.  Light armor has the highest Dodge limits of any type of armor, allowing high DEX characters to dodge attacks while still providing some protection.  It takes up less slots than heavier armors, allowing characters with less Strength to equip it without worrying about encumbrance.  Finally, light armors are cheaper than other armor types, allowing them to be repaired more easily.  Because of their low base AC and lack of damage reduction, light armors are weak when taking many attacks in one turn.

#### Medium Armor
Medium armors strike a balance between mobility and protection.  They often provide enough protection to grant their wearers a bit of damage reduction, while still granting enough mobility for a dodge.  Medium armor provides decent AC, while being light enough to make sure players are not too encumbered. 

\pagebreak

#### Heavy Armor
Heavy armor gives up mobility to provide the ultimate protection for the wearer.  Heavy armor boasts the highest AC of any armor type, but does not allow the wearer to dodge at all.  It is best suited for high STR characters who can equip the armor without becoming too encumbered.  Heavy armor also provides the highest damage reduction of any armor type, making it best suited for fighting multiple enemies at once.

##### Armor List

|Armor | Type | AC | Dodge Limit | Damage Reduction | Cost | Slots |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Padded | Light | 11 | None | None | 5 gp | 2 |
| Leather | Light | 12 | None | None | 10 gp | 3 |
| Hardened Leather | Light | 12 | None | Half-Proficiency | 30 gp | 4 |
| Studded Leather | Light | 13 | +5 | None | 45 gp | 4 |
| Plated Leather* | Light | 14 | +4 | Half-Proficiency | 400 gp | 6 |
| Hide | Medium | 12 | +2 | None | 10 gp | 4 |
| Chain Shirt | Medium | 13 | +2 | Half-Proficiency | 50 gp | 6 |
| Chain Vest | Medium | 12 | +3 | Half-Proficiency | 30 gp | 4 |
| Scale Mail* | Medium | 14 | +2 | Half-Proficiency | 50 gp | 8 |
| Breastplate | Medium | 15 | +2 | Half-Proficiency | 400 gp | 6 |

\* Disadvantage on stealth checks

\columnbreak

### Shields
There is more than one kind of shield.  Different shields can be used for different purposes.

##### Shield Types
| Shield | AC | Don/Doff | Abilities Gained | Slot Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Buckler | +0 | Bonus Action | Parry and Riposte | 2 |
| Round Shield | +0 | Bonus Action | Deflect | 2 |
| Shield | +2 | 1 Action | None | 3|
| Tower Shield | +3 | 1 Action | Shield Defense | 5 |

**Parry and Riposte.**  As a reaction, when your character is attacked, you may add your Dodge modifier to your AC.  If your AC is greater than the attack roll by 6 or more you make make an attack of opportunity against the attacker.  You may not use your dodge action on this attack.

**Deflect.** Add +3 to your Dodge modifier. Your Dodge modifier cannot be higher than your armor's Dodge Limit.

**Shield Defense**  As a reaction, if you aren't incapacitated, you can add your shield's AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful effect that targets you, and you do not gain disadvantage on this check from encumbrance.

## Equipment and Rule Changes

### Spellcaster Foci
All casters need something in order to cast their spells.  Different classes require different items for their casting.

#### Bard
A Bard's magical power comes from their music.  The bard's magical focus is their instrument.  The bard's instrument must be nearby(within 30 ft) in order for the bard to cast.

#### Cleric / Paladin
Clerics/Paladins require a holy symbol in order to cast their spells.  The symbol can be on an amulet or other jewelry which must be on the Cleric's/Paladin's person, or the symbol could be engraved on a shield, weapon, or other armor, or even tattooed on your person. If this symbol is destroyed or damaged it can prevent or weaken your magic.

#### Druid / Ranger
Druids/Rangers require a druidic focus for their spellcasting.  This druidic focus must be some natural element that can be kept on their person using an amulet or other jewelry etc.

#### Sorcerer / Warlock
A sorcerer/warlock requires an arcane focus to channel their arcane powers.  All arcane foci weigh 1 slot and must be held in a hand in order to safely cast spells.

#### Wizard
Instead of an arcane focus, the wizard requires a spellbook in order to cast their spells.  The spellbook weighs 1 slot and must be on the wizard's person in order for the wizard to cast.


### Light
Light rules are complicated.  Tracking light sources, where light is dim, and how that affects you character is difficult.  These rule simplifications will make some parts of the light rules easier.

#### Darkvision
For player characters, darkvision is no longer perfect.  It becomes the following ability.

**Darkvision.**  You can see up to 10 ft away in darkness, and get no penalties to Perception in dim light.

#### Light Cantrip
The *Light* cantrip requires concentration.

#### Torches and Lanterns
Now that darkvision and the light cantrip are weaker, other light sources become more important.

**Torch.** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20 foot radius, and dim light in a 40 foot radius, as long as it is being held, or in a scone or wall hanging.  If the torch is left on the ground, it provides bright light in a 5 foot radius, and dim light in a 10 foot radius.  
 
**Lamp.** A lamp casts bright light in a 15 foot radius and dim light in a 30 foot radius. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.  A lamp can be attached to a character’s belt while still lit as an action, allowing a character to use both hands while it is still lit, but if the lamp is struck while lit, it will cover the character in oil and deal fire damage to them.

\pagebreak


**Lantern, Hooded.** A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30 foot radius and dim light in a 60 foot radius.  Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask of oil.  As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5 foot radius.  Also as an action, you may attach the hooded lantern to a belt while still lit, allowing a character to use both hands while it is still lit, but if the lantern is struck while lit, it will cover the character in oil and deal fire damage to them.

**Lantern, Bullseye.** A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60 foot cone and dim light in a 120 foot cone.  Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask of oil.  As an action, you may attach the hooded lantern to a belt while still lit, allowing a character to use both hands while it is still lit, but if the lantern is struck while lit, it will cover the character in oil and deal fire damage to them.

**Candle.** For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5 foot radius and dim light in a 10 foot radius.

### Healing
Healer's Kits are normally used to stabilize downed creatures during combat, but they can be used outside of combat to bind wounds.  Any character with a Healer's Kit and proficiency in Medicine gains the Healer ability.

**Healer.** You can spend 5 minutes and 1 charge of you healer's kit to bind a creature's wounds.  That creature may spend 1 hit die as if they short rested.  Once a creature has gained hit points in this way, thy cannot be healed by this ability again until they have finished a short rest.

### Rations and Resting
When an adventurer rests, they must eat rations in order to gain the effects of the rest.  Different rations will have different effects on an adventurer during the rest.  You can fit 5 rations into one slot, and different rations can be mixed and matched into one slot.

#### Cold Rations
Cold rations require little to no preparation to consume and typically include jerky, biscuits, dried fruit, nuts and berries.  These rations are cheap and easily produced and stored, but they provide the least benefits.  A character can eat cold rations in 30 minutes.

#### Hot Rations
Hot rations require utensils and time to prepare.  They typically include vegetables, salted meats, breads, spices and gravies, which can be combined into sandwiches, stews, or other prepared meals.  They grant small bonuses during rests, but require a cooking fire to prepare.  Hot rations also require a mess kit. (PHB pg. 150, 152).  Hot rations take 30 minutes to prepare and 30 minutes to eat.

#### Fine Rations
Fine rations take a long time to prepare and require specialized equipment.  They include fine cheeses and breads, fresh raw meats, expensive fruits and vegetables, and exotic spices and sauces.  These rations are the most expensive and spoil very quickly if not properly kept.  However, they provide incredibly powerful bonuses.  Someone with proficiency in cook's utensils must spend 2 hours preparing these rations, and they take 30 minutes to eat. 

|Rations|Short Rest|Long Rest|
|---|---|---|
|Cold Rations| Characters cannot use more than half of their hit dice, rounded down, during this rest.| Characters only regain hit points equal to half their hit point total, rounded down, and regain half of their hit dice.  If characters do not reach full health they may spend hit dice as they could during a short rest after they regain their hit dice.|
|Hot Rations| Characters can use hit dice normally, and upon finishing the meal, characters regain half their hit dice.|Characters regain all of their hit points and all of their hit dice.|
|Fine Rations| Characters regain all of their hit dice, and recover one level of exhaustion.  Some classes also gain other bonuses. | Characters regain all of their hit points and all of their hit dice.  All characters eating the meal gain temporary hit points equal to the Cook's Level + WIS modifier + proficiency bonus.  These temporary hit points expire after 24 hours.  Recover two levels of exhaustion instead of one.|

\pagebreak

|Class| Recovery|
|---|---|
|Barbarian| Replenish a number of rages equal to your proficiency bonus. |
|Bard| Regain Bardic Inspirations equal to your proficiency bonus|
|Cleric| Regain a number of spell slots with levels equal to half your cleric level|
|Druid| Regain one use of Wild Shape|
|Fighter| *Battlemaster*: Recover a number of superiority dice equal to your proficiency bonus |
|Monk| Regain ki points equal to your proficiency bonus|
|Paladin| Restore hit points in your Lay On Hands pool equal to 2 times your Paladin level|
|Ranger| Restore spells slots with levels equal to your proficieny bonus|
|Rogue| *Arcane Trickster*: Recover spell slots equal to your proficency bonus|
|Sorcerer| Recover spell slots equal to half your Sorcerer level|
|Warlock| You gain one temporary spell slot that must be used before any of your other spell slots.  It expires at the start of your next short or long rest|
|Wizard| Recover spell slots equal to half your Wizard level|


|Rations| Cost | Spoil |
|---|---|---|
|Cold Rations| 5 cp | 30 days |
|Hot Rations| 5 sp | 10 days |
|Fine Rations| 5 gp | 2 days |

#### Foraging
All players gain the Forager ability, allowing they to search for food.  

**Forager.**  During a long rest, spend 2 hours hunting or foraging.  Make a Survival ability check.  At the end of the two hours, gain cold rations equal to you check / 5 (rounded down).  You can also make this check while not resting, but you may not travel while foraging.  Poor terrain may cause you to roll at disadvantage or be unable to use this skill.  Rangers in their favored terrain may make two checks and add their totals together.

#### Exhaustion
The morning after a long rest, each character recovers one level of exhaustion.

\columnbreak

.

### Resting Conditions

While taking a long rest in the wild inclement weather or other conditions could prevent your character from resting properly.  If these problems are not addressed your character has a chance of taking a level of exhaustion after the long rest.  Different conditions will add modifiers to the DC of a CON check you must make in order to not take a level of exhaustion.


|Inclement Condition | Description | Preventative Equipment / Measure | DC mod |
|---|---|---|---|
|Cold| In some regions, when the sun sets the cold gets bad enough to keep adventurers from sleeping soundly.| Bedroll / Campfire | +10 |
|Precipitation| Rain and snow will sap an adventurer's strength and exhaust them.| Tent / Cave | +10|
|Rough Terrain| No good location to lie may cause discomfort and insomnia.| Bedroll / Camp in an open clearing| +5 |
|Disturbance| Sleep can be interrupted by surprises and combat. | None / Don't get caught! | +5 |

When a long rest is finished, if any inclement conditions harried your rest, add up th modifiers of all conditions that you did not prevent and make a CON save against that DC.  On a failure, take a level of exhaustion.

If you really don't want to take that level of exhaustion, for each 2 hours that you extend your long rest, reduce the DC of the CON save by 5.

**Campfire.** Campfires are useful for staying warm during the night and cooking hot rations, but smoke from a campfire will alert any creatures in the area to your presence, making nighttime encounters more likely.

**Camp Location.** Making camp in a cave or den will keep your characters more hidden from view, but force your character to sleep on rough terrain.  Making camp in an open area or clearing will make nighttime encounters more likely.

#### Order of Rests
It is possible for short or long rests to be interrupted by combat or other threats.  Benefits of a rest may not be acquired if it is interrupted.  For short rests, characters recover when they finish eating.  For long rests, characters recover at the end of the 8 hour period as long as they have slept some and eaten.  The CON save against exhaustion occurs immediately after the character recovers.

Size: 8 slots

Luckily, when the sack is dropped, unless it is torn, the items inside are protected.

**Alchemy Jug**

This ceramin jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty.  Sloshing sounds can be heard when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.  Once per long rest, you can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid.  Afterward, you can uncork and pour that liquid out.  The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid named.

**Silver Raven Figurine**

Large Trinket (3 trinket slots)

If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature.  If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.  The creature is friendly toward you and your companions.  It understands your language and obeys your spoken commands.  If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  The silver raven exists for 12 hours.  At the end of this duration it reverts back to its figurine form.  It reverts back to its figurine form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.  When the raven becomes a figurine again, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.  While in raven form, you may cast animal messenger on it for free at will.

**+1 Arrows**

1 slot (20)
