# Fourthbot
Fourth DM in our DnD group
new_main.py currently runs Cog framework.. Only has one command right now.  Goal is to start migrating commands from main.py to different Cogs.

Currently cleaning up XP cog

In order to test your Cogs, you'll have to create your own discord bot for testing purposes.  I think right now the token it's using is for my old PartyBot.  If you run on that you won't be able to access it.
