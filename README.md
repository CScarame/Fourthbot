# Fourthbot
Fourth DM in our DnD group
new_main.py currently runs Cog framework.. Only has one command right now.  Goal is to start migrating commands from main.py to different Cogs.

In order to test your Cogs, you'll have to create your own discord bot for testing purposes.  I think right now the token it's using is for my old PartyBot.  If you run on that you won't be able to access it.

Here's the link to a tutorial: https://www.devdungeon.com/content/make-discord-bot-python

## Item Overhaul
- Create JSON doc full of items with descriptions, flags, and statistics
- Create !item command for viewing item details
- Create inventory that tracks player items
- Add player ability to add their own items to be defined later!

## Spellbook

- Create character specific Spellbooks.
- Make a way to add spells to the spellbook.
- Make a spellbook search command to find your spells based on level or category
- Make an easy way to add possible new spells to the spellbook
